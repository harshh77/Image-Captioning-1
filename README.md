# Image Captioning
This Repository Contains code for image captioning. The code uses TensorFlow 
Hub mobilenet module for image features. These features are given as hidden state input to the LSTM Cells. 
The code here is inspired by @hvass-labs TensorFlow tutorials. But is changed a little for experimentation.
